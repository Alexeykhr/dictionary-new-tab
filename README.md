# Chrome Extension - Dictionary New Tab

## Introducing

Sometimes itâ€™s very difficult (almost always) to force yourself to learn a new language.
This extension is for the Chrome browser, which will help make at least constantly see new words for yourself.

This is also a practical example of how to use Webpack + Chrome Extension :)

## Hotkeys

Since there are no bookmarks, top sites and other sections, here is a list of the necessary hot keys
for quick access to the address line and other sections without using the mouse

- `CTRL + W` - close tab | **global**
- `CTRL + T` - new tab | **global**
- `CTRL + L` - focus on address line | **global**
- `SPACE` - next word | **app**
- `ALT + Q` - move to google translate (like "query") | **app**
- `ALT + S` - Say the word, ttl (like "say") | **app**

!
- notification (false or repeat time)
- background
!

- g_name
- g_translate
- g_transcription
- g_translations
- g_definitions
- g_examples
- g_updated_at

- view_at
- views
- quality

## How can this be improved?

- [ ] Polls of learned words
- [ ] Notifications and notification settings (for example, every 5 minutes a new word)
- [ ] Better design (without using any libraries like React, Vue)
- [ ] Hotkey editing
