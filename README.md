# Chrome Extension - Dictionary New Tab

## Introducing

Sometimes itâ€™s very difficult (almost always) to force yourself to learn a new language.
This extension is for the Chrome browser, which will help make at least constantly see new words for yourself.

This is also a practical example of how to use Webpack + Chrome Extension :)

## Hotkeys

Since there are no bookmarks, top sites and other sections, here is a list of the necessary hot keys
for quick access to the address line and other sections without using the mouse

- `CTRL + T` - new tab | **global**
- `CTRL + W` - close tab | **global**
- `CTRL + L` - focus on address line | **global**
